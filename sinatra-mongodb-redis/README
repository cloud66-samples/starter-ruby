This is a simple starter template for a Sinatra app ready to deploy to Heroku.

To use:
* pull down repo
* rename app.rb and App class to whatever you want
* heroku create --stack cedar

This template uses MongoDB, PostgresSQL, Redis and Memcached all at the same, not because that is a good way to build an app, but so that each datastore is already setup and ready to go.

That being said, to use the app as-is, you will need to install these Heroku add-ons:
* Redis To Go
* MongoLab
* Memcache
* Shared Database
